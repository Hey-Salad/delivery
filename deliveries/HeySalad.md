### Architecture Overview

HeySalad Tasha implements a modern dApp architecture built on Next.js 15 with React 19, featuring:

**Core Technologies:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and custom CSS theming
- **Blockchain**: Polkadot Asset-Hub integration via `@polkadot/api`
- **Voice Technology**: 11Labs conversational AI for natural speech interaction
- **AI Analysis**: Google Gemini for food image/video analysis
- **Banking**: Monzo API integration for transaction verification
- **Deployment**: Firebase hosting with custom domain

**Key Components:**

1. **Voice Assistant System** (`/app/voice-assistant/`):
   - Real-time speech recognition and synthesis
   - Natural language processing for food waste conversations
   - Audio recording with WebRTC and MediaRecorder API
   - Integration with 11Labs Agent API for conversational responses

2. **Token Minting Engine** (`/services/PolkadotTokenService.ts`):
   - Asset-Hub integration for FWT token creation
   - Cryptographic signing for transaction verification
   - Dynamic token calculation based on waste reduction metrics
   - Cross-chain compatibility with Polkadot ecosystem

3. **Monzo Banking Integration** (`/api/monzo/`):
   - OAuth 2.0 flow for secure account connection
   - Transaction analysis for food purchase verification
   - Machine learning correlation between purchases and waste reduction
   - Real-time spending pattern analysis

4. **AI Food Analysis** (`/services/foodAnalysisService.ts`):
   - Computer vision for food freshness assessment
   - Nutritional analysis and waste potential scoring
   - Environmental impact calculations (CO2, water footprint)
   - Actionable recommendations for waste prevention

### Technical Implementation Details

**Voice Assistant Flow:**
```typescript
1. User initiates voice recording
2. Audio captured via WebRTC MediaRecorder
3. Audio sent to 11Labs Agent API for processing
4. Natural language understanding extracts food waste actions
5. Structured data fed to token minting system
6. Voice response synthesized and played back
```

**Token Minting Process:**
```typescript
1. Waste reduction activity logged via voice or manual input
2. AI verification assesses claim credibility (confidence scoring)
3. Monzo integration verifies related food purchases (optional)
4. Token amount calculated using emission rate formula
5. Asset-Hub transaction created and signed
6. FWT tokens minted to user's Polkadot address
```

**Banking Verification Logic:**
```typescript
1. User connects Monzo account via OAuth
2. System retrieves food-related transactions (7-day window)
3. Machine learning matches purchases to waste reduction claims
4. Confidence scoring enhances token reward multiplier
5. Transaction metadata enriches waste reduction insights
```

## Testing Guide

### Prerequisites

**Required Setup:**
- Polkadot wallet extension (Polkadot{.js}, Talisman, or SubWallet)
- Microphone access for voice features
- Camera access for image analysis
- Stable internet connection

**Optional for Enhanced Testing:**
- Monzo account for banking integration

- Mobile device for native camera testing

### Step-by-Step Testing Instructions

#### 1. Wallet Connection & Setup

```bash
# Test wallet integration
1. Visit https://tasha.heysalad.app/
2. Click "Connect Wallet" in dashboard
3. Select wallet extension (Polkadot{.js}/Talisman/SubWallet)
4. Approve connection and select account
5. Verify balance display shows Westend testnet tokens
6. Confirm wallet address: 12giVP5pP8vSdvMNrZPNQiNDUxCv2ST8qpEY6e3pQWD6ziJr (or user's address)
```

**Expected Results:**
- Wallet connects within 3-5 seconds
- Balance displays correctly formatted (e.g., "1.2345 WND")
- Connection persists across browser sessions
- Account switching works seamlessly

#### 2. Voice Assistant Testing

```bash
# Test complete voice workflow
1. Navigate to /voice-assistant
2. Ensure wallet is connected and authenticated
3. Click microphone button to start recording
4. Speak clearly: "I donated 2 kilograms of bread to the local food bank today"
5. Click stop recording when finished
6. Verify audio playback works correctly
7. Click "Send to Tasha" to process with AI
8. Wait for 11Labs processing (5-10 seconds)
9. Verify voice response plays automatically
10. Check conversation history appears in interface
```

**Expected Results:**
- Audio recording captures clearly (visual feedback during recording)
- Processing completes without timeout errors
- AI extracts food items: ["bread"]
- Waste reduction actions: ["donation"]
- Confidence score above 80%
- Voice response relates to user's input
- Conversation persists in session history

#### 3. Token Minting Workflow

```bash
# Test end-to-end token creation
1. Complete voice assistant interaction (from test #2)
2. Navigate to token minting interface
3. Verify waste reduction data pre-populated:
   - Amount: 2000g (from "2 kilograms")
   - Type: "donation" (from AI analysis)
   - Description: Auto-generated from voice transcript
4. Review calculated token amount (should show ~20 FWT based on emission rate)
5. Click "Mint Tokens" button
6. Sign transaction in wallet popup
7. Wait for Asset-Hub confirmation (30-60 seconds)
8. Verify success message with transaction hash
9. Check wallet balance updated with new FWT tokens
```

**Expected Results:**
- Token calculation: 2000g × 0.01 emission rate = 20 FWT
- Transaction signs successfully without errors
- Block hash returned from Asset-Hub
- Wallet balance increases by exactly 20 FWT tokens
- Transaction visible on Polkadot explorer

#### 4. Image Analysis Integration

```bash
# Test AI food analysis
1. Navigate to /image-analysis
2. Take photo of food item using camera
3. Wait for Google Gemini analysis (5-10 seconds)
4. Review 5-card swipeable interface:
   - Overview: Food type identification + confidence
   - Analysis: Freshness, nutrition, quantity estimates

6. Process minting workflow
7. Verify tokens created for selected data types
```

**Expected Results:**
- Food identification accuracy >70% for clear images
- All analysis cards populate with relevant data
